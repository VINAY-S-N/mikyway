			<h1>We are the world's largest university</h1>
			<p>
			We have one of the most diverse student populations in the country and it is our mission 
			to widen participation in higher education among traditionally under-represented groups.</p>
		
<ul>
<li>62.8% of the University’s students are from BAME backgrounds, compared to 31.1% in the sector</li>
<li>60.2% of our students are female, 4.3% higher than the sector average</li>
<li>57.1% of our students are mature (aged 21 and over on entry),<br>compared to the sector average of 27.8%</li>
<li>56% of our students are from Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)<br> 1-2 quintiles compared to 41.6% in the sector</li>
<li>32% of our staff, and 28% of our academic staff, are from black,<br> Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds,
 compared to 16% of academic staff across the higher education sector</li>
<li>30% of our Professoriate are from BAME backgrounds compared to 8.4% in the sector.</li>
</ul>
<p>These statistics are for the 2018-19 academic year.

The Claude Littner Business School won the Business School of the Year at the
THE Awards 2019 in recognition of work being done to reduce the ethnic minority student attainment gap.<br>
 Through its ‘Fulfilment through Challenge’ programme,
 the Business School has reduced its ethnic minority attainment gap to a historic low of 0.8%.<br>

 The programme breaks down barriers to social mobility by raising student confidence and aspirations
 and creating a seamless transition from education to employment for students whose
 socio-economic backgrounds make them less likely to gain a footing on competitive career ladders.</p>
